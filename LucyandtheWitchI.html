					<p style="text-align:justify;">Merryland was a small village by the sea. The name was
strangely in accordance with the villagers who dwelt there.
They were a bunch of kind, amiable and happy-go-lucky people
who consciously or unconsciously upheld the meaning of ‘Merry’
in Merryland. The only gloomy thing about Merryland was
Ernica, the evil Witch. She used to stay at the extreme end of
the village in a typical witch like terrifying house secluded from
the rest of the village. No one dared to go near to her place. She
too kept herself locked up in her house most of the times and
engrossed in witch-craft. Whenever she used to come out, the
villagers would maintain a safe distance from her. That is the
only time when they lost their ‘merry’. There have been rare
incidents of Ernica cursing people. However, her evil presence
or her curses have not been that deadly till now. Perhaps, she
was not a very powerful witch. Sometimes at odd hours at night,
people could hear her screaming and chanting spells but no one
knows what witch-craft she performs. It only triggers a chill
running down their spine.</p>
				
					<p style="text-align:justify;">Lucy, a seven years old girl, lived with her family in the
village. Her father was a fisherman. Most of the times he used
to be out in the sea. Her mother used to sell flowers and garlands
in the market. Every day, early in the morning, Lucy and her
little brother Joe used to go out to pluck flowers. Joe was two
years younger than Lucy. Their little hearts brimmed over with
joy while collecting the flowers and putting those in the baskets.
After returning home with a basket full of fragrance, their
mother would serve them breakfast. Lucy loved to take care ofher brother till her mother returned home after selling those
flowers.</p>
                                 <p style="text-align:justify;">Lucy and Joe have seen Ernica once till now. It was just
two three days back. It was a pleasant sunny day and they both
had gone to the market with their mother. They were sitting
with their mother when all of a sudden every one silenced and
were staring in one particular direction. Lucy saw a tall, lean
woman in a black attire and a pointed hat on her head
approaching. She had a terrifying serious look on her face. She
knew about Ernica and guessed that it was none other than her.
As she passed by, everyone kept silent and their eyes followed
her. Their faces were pale. Fortunately, she went away without
creating any nuisance. It seems she was just going through the
market to some other place. The villagers were expecting her to
return by the same way sometime later but fortunately that did
not happen. Lucy will never forget that day and so her brother.
That night, terrible cries and chanting pierced the ears of the
villagers!!! Lucy and Joe were petrified with fear whole night
with their mother trying to calm them.</p>
                                 <p style="text-align:justify;">Few days later a terrifying thing was noticed. Ernica had
started coming out every night. She steps into someone’s
farmland and takes away farm animals!!! A villager who tried
to stop her was cursed by her: “the silence curse”... This curse
takes away the voice from a person forever!!! No one dares to
stop her after that. Her nuisance continued and the villagers
grew anxious about this. They were losing all their farm
animals!! They could not think of any way to stop her. They even
tried pleading but all went in vain. It seemed that she was using
the animals or animal parts for some horrible witch act of
hers.... But what is that??? Who knows what she will donext...?? She successfully snatched away the “Merry” from
Merryland.</p>
                                 <p style="text-align:justify;">Lucy was a brave girl unlike the other children in the
village. She desperately wanted to stop and punish the witch.
She could not see the plight of everyone. One morning, after her
mother left home, she had a terrible plan. She told Joe that she
is going out to bring some apples for him since Joe loved apples.
She will be returning soon. Joe was a quiet and obedient kid. He
believed his sister and waited at home for the apples. Lucy ran
towards Ernica’s house!!!</p>
                                 <p style="text-align:justify;">It’s not that she was not afraid. She could feel the bitter,
blood-curdling fear within her but it won’t stop her. She slowed
down as she approached the witch’s house. It was a dark,
dilapidated and quite old house. She did not know what to do.
Going and knocking at the door would be too desperate or may
be an act of foolishness too. So, she went around the house and
came to an open window at the back of the house. She felt lucky
that the witch has not seen her yet. It was silent inside the
house and the surroundings too. At the window she noticed
something. There was a cage hanging and inside a small
colourful bird was hopping around. She approached towards the
cage. The bird noticed her and it started strongly flapping its
wings and hopping around inside the cage. Lucy got frightened.
It seemed like the bird wanted her to open the cage so that it
could escape. Lucy felt pity for the bird. A little, innocent,
beautiful bird caged by an evil witch!! Such a poor bird! She
slowly reached her hands out towards the cage door. The bird
stopped hovering. The door was opened. The bird came out
happily flapping its wings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
To her surprise, there was a sudden blue spark and Lucy
would not believe her eyes!! The bird transformed into a
beautiful white fairy and she was standing before her... Lucy
did not move. The fairy knelt down and heartily thanked Lucy
for releasing her. The witch had cast a spell on her and had kept
her as a bird prisoner for years. Thanks to Lucy that she is free
now. She expressed her gratitude towards Lucy. Lucy was all in
a trance till now. She realized what she had done. She smiled at
the fairy. The fairy hugged the little child and said that her
name is Melissa. Lucy said her name too. “What are you doing
alone in such a place, Lucy?” Melissa asked with a soft and
worried voice. Lucy immediately told Melissa everything.
Melissa quietly listened to her and then said with her soothing
voice, “It’s very brave of you Lucy!! You have freed me from a
curse. I am grateful to you. Now it’s my time to help you out.
You are at the right time Lucy. Ernica is not at home right now.
Every day at this time she goes somewhere and returns late in
the evening. We have ample time in hand to do our work. If you
allow me to help you Lucy then I have a plan.” Lucy’s face
brightened to hear this. She thought that it is a lucky day for
her. She got a fairy friend who could help her to punish Ernica.
She readily accepted Melissa’s proposal. Melissa said, “Lucy, I
have been here for years. I know almost everything about
Ernica, atleast everything related to her within the house. She
has her weakness hidden within the house: her soul!! She has
kept it separately in a safe place so that she cannot be killed by
any one. A witch can only be killed by burning her which means
burning her soul. Ernica cannot be killed now by setting her on
fire because her soul will remain untouched. If we can burn her
soul, then she will die. I know where her soul is kept. Once it is
in our hands, we can burn it and kill her. However, you need to be careful once you step inside the house. I will guide you.
Follow me Lucy and don’t touch anything. Let’s go.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Lucy and Melissa sneaked into the house through the open
window. It was dark and gloomy inside even during the day. The
place was full of dust and cobwebs and a strange odour which
Lucy did not like at all. There were pieces of weird things like
animal bones, body parts lying here and there. Lucy followed
Melissa as she went upstairs. Upstairs was more awkward.
There were no separate rooms. It was one big hall and in the
middle of the hall was a huge pot filled with some pale green
potion. It smelled awful!! Lucy was afraid and tightly held
Melissa’s hand. At one corner, there was the witch’s broom.
Everything was exactly like what stories of witches she had
heard of. Only one thing was missing, the witch’s black cat. Lucy
wished it was not there. Melissa took Lucy to one dark corner.
She lifted a part of the carpet lying on the floor. The dust from
the carpet made Lucy sneeze. “Sssshhh”, said Melissa. There
was a door on the floor. Melissa carefully lifted the door. It was
so dark that nothing was visible. Melissa chanted some spell in
a soft voice and soon there was a glowing ball in her hand. Lucy
could see stairs going down. “This light will help us to find our
way. Follow me.” Lucy followed Melissa downstairs. There were
not many stairs. When the stairs ended, she could see a vacant
place. The walls of the place were made up of blocks of stones.
Just as Lucy was about to step forward, she heard
“meeaawww...”. She was right, it’s the witch’s black cat. Those
glowing eyes seem to devour her. Melissa told her not to be
afraid of it. Still Lucy could not assure herself. Melissa gave the
glowing ball to Lucy and asked her to hold in one hand. She took
it in her trembling little hands. Seeing Lucy very frightened, Melissa again held Lucy’s hand and took her to the wall. Then
she asked Lucy to wait. Meanwhile, the cat sat at one place
staring at them and intermittently letting out a “meeaawww”.
Lucy was relieved that it did not anything to them. There was
a cross sign on one of the stone blocks. Melissa carefully pulled
out that block of stone and kept on the floor. Lucy was surprised.
She was eagerly waiting to see what Melissa was taking out now
from the hole where the stone was there. It was a dry piece of
leaf!!! Lucy thought, “That’s it!!!??? That’s a soul???”. Melissa
turned towards Lucy and said, “You must be thinking that this
is only a dry leaf. But once you put this dry leaf into the fire, you
will know. It will be the end of Ernica. So, we should go now and
burn it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Lucy’s heart was brimming over with joy. Atlast, she will
be the one to end Ernica. “Merry” will come back to Merryland.
It was really a lucky day for her. After her work is done, she
would thank Melissa for all the help and take her to her home.
And yes... apples for Joe too. He must be eagerly waiting. All
these thoughts rushed through Lucy’s mind as the two went
upstairs. After reaching upstairs, Melissa closed the door and
the glowing ball disappeared. Lucy was so amazed to see all
these. She had never been so close to magic. Melissa searched
for some candles on the shelves in the hall. Soon she lit a candle.
They went to a table. Melissa placed the leaf on the table and
the candle too. “Now burn the soul Lucy...” she said. Lucy stared
at her with a puzzled look on her face. “I...I will do it??”, she
asked Melissa. Melissa replied with a smile, “Yes Lucy, you are
the brave girl. She should die in your hands. I am just the one
to help you out. It’s a reward that you are getting for your
bravery. Now, don’t be late. Do it fast.” Lucy took the candle inher hands. Her hands were trembling. The leaf was lying on the
table. She bent the candle to the leaf so that it catches fire.
There it was all ablaze!!! She gazed at it burning with sparks of
blue, green and red.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Soon only the ashes were left. She turned towards Melissa
to share the happiness. But... where is Melissa? She was there
by her side just before she set the leaf on fire. And Lucy was so
lost in watching the leaf burn that she had forgotten about
Melissa. Now, where is she? Lucy looked at her sides and then
turned backwards. Someone was standing in the dark. Lucy
could only see the silhouette of a woman. She must be Melissa!!!
As Lucy was about to approach her, she stepped forward out of
the darkness. Lucy stood there with her eyes open aghast!!!
There was a tall, lean woman in a black attire and a pointed hat
on her head. The only difference was that now she had a wicked
smile on her face. It was Ernica!!!!</p>
